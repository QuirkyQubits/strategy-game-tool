# strategy-game-tool

This is a tool used to quickly create levels for a strategy game or other array-based RPG game.
For some reason, this tool only works in Google Chrome.
Users can color the grid by selecting a tile type and hovering the mouse
over grid squares to color the grid squares to be the color ofthat tile type.
